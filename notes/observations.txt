The range of tuneability down from infinity for the tuenable lens is unknown.
It could be Longer (best case) or it could be shorter (worst case, could be very possible)

(for the conclusions below, refer to the screenshots of the graphs generated with the script)
With a Longer_Tunable_EFD_Range.png, using a paired lens with a known longer focal length (e.g. >100mm) would give a measurable EFD at the output that would allow characterising teh lens's EFD VS the applied voltage
With a Shorter_Tunable_EFD_Range (and it could be even shorter than that), the measured EFD at the output would be very hard/impossible to measure, no matter the known focal length (for reasonable values) or the distance between the tuneable lens and the known-focal-length lens

Suggested course of action:
- quickly try to ballpark-identify the range of tuneability for the lens by using e.g. a fixed-focus-lens of 100mm or so: is it a shorter or larger range?
- if it's larger then happy days: characterise the lenses
- if it's shorter then another approach is needed >> an example could be trying to exploit this fact: "The focal length of a thin convex lens can be easily measured by using it to form an image of a distant light source on a screen."[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_length]
